# Country search app 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Live link

[Click here](https://1bsilver.github.io/Country-app/)

#### Note:
- For the temperature I have used weatherstack api and **would not work** in the live link.
- For the weather icon I have used material-ui-icons, they would not work too in the live link.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

* If there are countries with matching name, a show button would appear for you to select the country you would like to view.
* If no matching name is found the search bar would notify you that no matching country is found.
* If the country has a unique name, the country data page would appear directly.

Example of the data country page when you click the show button.
#### The view page displays the following data: 
1. Country name
2. Capital name
3. Population
4. Languages spoken
5. Weather in the capital city
6. Wind speed (in mph) and direction.
